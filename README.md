Decentralised Document Identity on ElastOS
==============

Developed for the Decentralised Hacks 2020 by ElastOS, Matic and Harmony

# Summary

This repo provide JAVA API to develop reference DID service application on Elastos.
This repo provide JAVA packages from SCIPR DIZK Framework

# DIZK

DIZK (pronounced /'diz…ôk/) is a Java library for distributed zero knowledge proof systems. DIZK provides Java-based implementations using Apache Spark. The library implements distributed polynomial evaluation/interpolation, computation of Lagrange polynomials, and multi-scalar multiplication. Using these scalable arithmetic subroutines, the library provides a distributed zkSNARK proof system that enables verifiable computations of up to billions of logical gates, far exceeding the scale of previous state-of-the-art solutions.

## DIZK Dependencies 

* Java SE 8+
* Apache Maven
* Fetched from pom.xml via Maven:
* Spark Core 2.10
* Spark SQL 2.10
* JUnit 4.11
* Google Java Format
